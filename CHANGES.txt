v0.3.1, 2014-07-21 -- CE Fix
	- The CE string generating functions had some mistakes. Sentences in
	CE are supposed to start with a lower case letter. Additionally, the
	sentences starting "there is" should follow the pattern "there is a
	*thing* named *identifier*."

v0.3.0, 2014-07-18 -- API Change
	- The code does exactly the same stuff, but I've moved a load of the
	functions around to make the API, (when I eventually publish one),
	make a lot more sense.

v0.2.0, 2014-07-18 -- Bug fixes
	- Removed duplicate entries when things have more than one class.
	- Removed green tags from definition statements.

v0.1.0, 2014-07-17 -- Initial Release
